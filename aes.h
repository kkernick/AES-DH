 * @brief The namespace containing AES encryption/decryption functions.
 * @remarks This code has been created with reference to:
 * https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.197-upd1.pdf
 * Herein referred to as "The Reference"
 * @remarks Another wonderful source is available here:
 * https://cs.ru.nl/~joan/papers/JDA_VRI_Rijndael_2002.pdf
 * Which we will refer to as the "2002 Paper"
 * @remarks AES is block cipher which takes a message of arbitrary size, alongside a
 * key, and returns a ciphertext that can be safely shared across an untrusted network.
 * AES breaks down a message into a set of 16 byte blocks, and extends the key into a
 * Key Schedule. It then repeatedly applies four operations to each block: SubBytes,
 * ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey. The amount of repetitions (Or rounds) depends
 * on the size of the key, with 10 rounds for a 128 bit key, 12 for 192, and 14 for 256.
 * The Key Schedule creates a unique key for each column of the block, for each round
 * Of the algorithm. Operations are typically performed in the Finite Field GF(256),
 * Which is a field of 256 elements. The reason for this is performance.
 * @remarks This implemention supports three modes of AES: ECB, CTR, and GCM. ECB takes
 * a message, and directly feeds it through AES to receive a ciphertext. CTR uses a nonce
 * value and runs this through AES to generate a block--or pad--that is then XOR'd against
 * The message in a similar fashion to the One-Time Pad. With an incrementing nonce, each
 * Pad will be unique, eliminating a key issue of ECB. Finally, GCM is essentially a version
 * of CTR that incorporates a MAC algorithm to provide integrity.

      // See all of Section 4 of the Reference for more details, but in essence we treat each byte as a
      // polynomial (IE 0b11000001 = x**8 + x**7 + x**0).

      // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field_arithmetic#Rijndael's_(AES)_finite_field

      // by hand, where we slowly move through the b value by shifting it to 0, check that shifted
      // first bit and "add" it to the result via an xor of A, and then preemptively check
      // for an overflow condition on the final bit of a (0x80 = 128), which then applies our
      // modulus to keep it bounded.

      // However, the main question that arises is why do we need to use this at all. The Reference makes

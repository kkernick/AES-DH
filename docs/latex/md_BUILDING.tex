If you’d like to build the applications from source, you can simply run {\ttfamily make} within the directory, and both the {\ttfamily main} and {\ttfamily aes} application will be built. If you’d prefer to only build one, simply specify that application after the make command, such as {\ttfamily make main} or {\ttfamily make aes}.

You’ll need the C++ compiler from the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)\+: {\ttfamily g++}. If you run into an error like\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{make:\ g++:\ No\ such\ file\ or\ directory}

\end{DoxyCode}


You’ll need to install it from your package manager of choice. Some common options include\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Debian-\/\+Based Distributions\+: {\ttfamily sudo apt-\/get install g++}
\item Fedora/\+RHEL\+: {\ttfamily sudo dnf install gcc-\/c++}
\item Arch-\/\+Based Distributions\+: \`{}sudo pacman -\/Syu gcc
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily main} uses Open\+SSL in order to generate HMAC values, and you may run into an error complaining that an Open\+SSL header could not be found\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{hmac.h:\ fatal\ error:\ openssl/hmac.h:\ No\ such\ file\ or\ directory}

\end{DoxyCode}


To fix this, you’ll need to install the Open\+SSL development headers. Again, some common examples\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Debian-\/\+Based Distributions\+: {\ttfamily sudo apt-\/get install libssl-\/dev}
\item {\ttfamily Fedora/\+RHEL\+:}sudo dnf install openssl-\/devel{\ttfamily }
\item {\ttfamily Arch-\/\+Based Distributions\+:}sudo pacman -\/Syu openssl\`{} 
\end{DoxyItemize}
